            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Collection of Exciting New Booze Books</h1><p>It seems like just about everyone has a cookbook, cocktail manual or spirits' history guide out on the market. A lot of superb ones cross our path with regularity-from new to old -but some really set themselves apart. Most recently we've been digging through four new offerings and each is very different from the next.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8dbd52c022b397f706e88ffffb31a04f102faa7c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

They spotted a humongous galaxy orbiting our own, where none had been seen before. It appeared, seemingly, out of nowhere. So, just how did the newly-discovered Crater 2 manage to pull off this feat, like a deer leaping from the interstellar bushes to stare us down through our collective headlights?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dd35d86c6f1815ff301b89ff31df46ba5d96e829.jpg"></article>]]></description>

In celebration of the impending release of Avengers: Age of Ultron, the Five Four subscription menswear service finds subtlety in the generally loud graphic medium by using Marvel's famous roster of superheroes to inspire its April capsule.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c00f82bc7a96b03780b683692320bb03f3b031f2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Wild Shape-Shifting Sofa Can Be Whatever You Want It to Be</h1><p>Carlo Ratti, who founded MIT's forward-thinking Senseable City Lab, has designed a sofa called Lift-Bit. It is on display at La Triennale in Milan, where innumerable furniture-makers showcase their work in an annual design fair.
